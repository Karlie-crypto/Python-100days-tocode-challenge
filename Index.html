    <h1>Gospel of God Church Fulfilment International</h1>
    <h2>The Prophesized Church "The Seventh Covenant"</h2>
    <p>Johane Masowe, a prominent figure in the Gospel of God Church in Zimbabwe, parallels another influential Shona prophet,     Johane Marange. Born in 1914 or 1915 in Gandanzara village, Masowe underwent a transformative religious experience in 1932, leading him to adopt an itinerant preaching ministry. Arrested in 1932 for unauthorized preaching, Masowe believed he was divinely commissioned as "John the Baptist" to advocate for repentance and baptism among Africans.

        Masowe's teachings emerged during colonialism's peak, addressing racial discrimination and the Great Depression's aftermath. Alongside Maranke, he pioneered the vaPostori movement, blending African Traditional Religion with Christianity. Despite colonial restrictions and multiple imprisonments, Masowe's influence expanded across Africa, with communities adopting unique practices like outdoor worship and a distinctive appearance.
        
        His teachings critiqued both African traditional practices and Eurocentric Christianity. While not universally accepted as the Messiah, some followers equated Masowe with Christ, emphasizing his role in liberating Africans. The vaPostori's commitment to their beliefs, their pilgrimage-like movement, and their prosperity reflect their deep-rooted faith and adaptability.</p>

              <p>
                  The calculator project was built using the tkinter library in Python for
                  creating a graphical user interface (GUI). The main interface consists of
                  a window with buttons for numbers (0-9) and basic arithmetic operations
                  (+, -, *, /). A global variable named expression holds the current
                  calculation input. When a button is clicked, its value is appended to the
                  expression. Upon pressing the '=' button, the eval() function processes
                  the expression to evaluate the arithmetic operation and display the result
                  on a label. If there's an error during evaluation, an "Error" message is
                  displayed. After displaying the result or an error, the expression is
                  reset to allow for a new calculation. Button placements were organized
                  using grid layout management in tkinter to structure the interface
                  effectively.

                  The Bingo Card Generator was developed using Python, incorporating the
                  Colorama library for text coloring. The primary function,
                  generate_bingo_card, constructs a 3x3 bingo card. It generates 8 unique
                  random numbers between 1 and 90, sorts them, and populates the card. The
                  central cell is reserved for the word 'BINGO!' displayed in yellow. The
                  display_table function formats and prints the bingo card rows, separating
                  them with horizontal lines for clarity. Finally, the main function,
                  display_bingo_card, initiates the display by showcasing "Karlie's Nan's
                  Bingo Card Generator" in yellow. The overall design ensures a visually
                  appealing and organized representation of a bingo card, fulfilling the
                  challenge requirements while leveraging color for enhanced readability.

                  The code defines a visual novel interface using Tkinter in Python. The
                  ChooseYourAdventure class manages pages with images and text. Depending on
                  the page number, it displays relevant content and options for the user.
                  Images are resized using PIL, and buttons allow progression to different
                  pages. An error occurred due to missing arguments in the show_page method.
                  The code has been rearranged to correct these issues, presenting a
                  structured flow for a text-based adventure with visual elements.
