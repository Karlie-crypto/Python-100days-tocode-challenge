          Hey there! ðŸŒŸ My name is Karlie Moyo, a passionate full-stack
          developer hailing from South Africa. Currently, skilled in JavaScript,
          C, Python, Ruby, React, Node.js, and more. Committed to creating

        <p>
          In my continuous pursuit of skill enhancement and disciplined
          learning, I undertook the '100 Days of Code' challenge. This
          initiative required dedicating a minimum of one hour daily to coding
          tasks and projects for a consecutive 100 days. Throughout this
          journey, I focused on refining my coding capabilities, expanding my
          technical expertise, and developing a consistent work ethic. Engaging
          with a vibrant online community, I shared my progress, collaborated on
          diverse projects, and leveraged feedback to drive continuous
          improvement. This experience not only enriched my programming skills
          but also reinforced my commitment to lifelong learning and
          professional growth.

        <h1>What I Have Learned!</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Greatness is a lot of small things done well</li>
          <li>The salt of patience seasons everything</li>
          <li>Grit alone is not enough develop passion and determination</li>
          <li>
            He who rejects change is the architect of decay. The only human
            institution which rejects progress is the cemetery
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3 Things I am excited about:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Skill Enhancement and Mastery</li>
          <li>Achievement and Personal Growth</li>
          <li>Community Engagement and Networking</li>
