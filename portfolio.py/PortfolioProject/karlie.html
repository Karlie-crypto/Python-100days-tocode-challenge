    <h1>Let's Tour to My Achievements:</h1>
    <h2>Day 73: Portfolio Project</h2>
    <p>The Portfolio project was crafted using HTML, serving both as a practice platform and a display of various achievements. This endeavor incorporated the integration of images seamlessly with textual content, enhancing user engagement and visual appeal. Leveraging HTML tags and components, the portfolio ensured a structured and organized presentation of information. Additionally, the inclusion of links facilitated easy navigation, directing users to specific project pages or related resources.

    <h2>Day 74: Portfolio Project Style.css</h2>   
    <p>
        The Portfolio project was designed using HTML and CSS, featuring vibrant colors, stylish alignments, and seamless image-text integration. Serving as both a practice platform and a showcase of achievements, it prioritized user engagement and visual appeal. Through structured HTML tags, CSS styles, and strategic alignments, the portfolio presented information in an organized manner. </p>

    <h2>Day 66: Calculator</h2>
    <p>The calculator project was built using the tkinter library in Python for
        creating a graphical user interface (GUI). The main interface consists of
        a window with buttons for numbers (0-9) and basic arithmetic operations
        (+, -, *, /). A global variable named expression holds the current
        calculation input. When a button is clicked, its value is appended to the
        expression. Upon pressing the '=' button, the eval() function processes
        the expression to evaluate the arithmetic operation and display the result
        on a label. If there's an error during evaluation, an "Error" message is
        displayed. After displaying the result or an error, the expression is
        reset to allow for a new calculation. Button placements were organized
        using grid layout management in tkinter to structure the interface
        effectively.</p>

    <h2>Day 43: The Bingo Card Generator</h2>       
    <p>The Bingo Card Generator was developed using Python, incorporating the
        Colorama library for text coloring. The primary function,
        generate_bingo_card, constructs a 3x3 bingo card. It generates 8 unique
        random numbers between 1 and 90, sorts them, and populates the card. The
        central cell is reserved for the word 'BINGO!' displayed in yellow. The
        display_table function formats and prints the bingo card rows, separating
        them with horizontal lines for clarity. Finally, the main function,
        display_bingo_card, initiates the display by showcasing "Karlie's Nan's
        Bingo Card Generator" in yellow. The overall design ensures a visually
        appealing and organized representation of a bingo card, fulfilling the
        challenge requirements while leveraging color for enhanced readability.</p>

    <h2>Day 69: The visual Novel</h2>  
    <p>The code defines a visual novel interface using Tkinter in Python. The
        ChooseYourAdventure class manages pages with images and text. Depending on
        the page number, it displays relevant content and options for the user.
        Images are resized using PIL, and buttons allow progression to different
        pages. An error occurred due to missing arguments in the show_page method.
        The code has been rearranged to correct these issues, presenting a
        structured flow for a text-based adventure with visual elements.</p>
